Run `npm install` in the root of the folder.

You may need to navigate into the `/frontend` and `/backend` folders to install the relevant dependencies.

To seed the database with the product data: `npm run dataImport`.

To run both the frontend and backend servers: `npm run dev` in root.

You may need to update the `proxy` script in the `frontend/package.json` dependent on which port you have the db configured to.
